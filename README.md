# Superflat Calculator
This calculator has been created a to assist in finding the nether coordinates to the nearest stronghold in a superflat world. 

**This program is not yet legal and verified by the JUICE moderators, but is in the process of verification.**

## Installation and Usage
To use, ensure this file is somewhere on your C Drive, and that you have Python installed (version 3+ of Python is required). 
Press the `windows key` (`windows + s` and `windows + r` will also work) and type `cmd`. Then press `enter` to open the command prompt. Paste the following line:

```
python -m pip install easymacro keyboard
```

To run the script, run the command:

```
cd the/directory/where/the/script/is && python calc.py
```

If you opened the command prompt in the directory that the script is in you can dismiss the `cd ... &&` part.

When in the nether, pressing `F3 + C` will copy your current in-game location to the clipboard. The command prompt window will return the coordinates, along with the angle and distance to said coordinates.

## Updates
Future versions may have a proper GUI, and will ensure that the player can only copy coordinates in the nether.
