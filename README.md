# SuperflatCalculator
This calculator has been created a to assist in finding the nether coordinates to the nearest stronghold. 

**This program is not yet legal and verified by the JUICE moderators, but is in the process.**

## Installation and Usage
To use, ensure this file is on somewhere your C Drive, and you have Python 3.8+ installed. 
Press the windows key and search "cmd" to open the command prompt. Paste the following line:

*pip install easymacro keyboard*

To run the file, run the command:

*python calc.py*

When in the nether, pressing F3 and C together  will copy your location to the clipboard, the command prompt window will return the coordinates, along with the angle and distance to said coordinates.

## Updates
Future versions may have a proper gui, and will ensure that the player can only copy coordinates in the nether.
